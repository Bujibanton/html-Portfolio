<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Website Development student trying to understand how websites are developed, coded, and hosted online for clients.
I am a quick learner trying to understand how things are done the right way </p>

<p>I believe that this course will be useful towards enhancing my understanding of websites and how to resolve website-related problems for clients. Although I have taken the course late, I believe that I won't be late in resolving clients' issues affecting their websites </p>
